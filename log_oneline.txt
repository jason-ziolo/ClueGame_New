6a4af76a4bb68fb1c7d5d1712fce67ec5290a3b1 Finished player movement functionality. Tried to make a dummy computer player movement but it is currecntly commented out. Also the Players turn ends weather or not they hit next turn, so that needs to be implemented. I also tried to get that in but it is currently a comment.

bda499e198641588b2a1469c54db54c77f901c6f REFACTOR: recSize determined by board size and window size
5884251a9ec4c21a576c9644c60a0700233f7912 REFACTOR: Moved DetectiveNotesDialog to GUI package
205a3cd2831a0cd0edd2cac13ba93a2f77383316 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/jason-ziolo/ClueGame_New
eb03b2a2b8f44c1d227f6245e3c845e9d6327bd6 Removed a lot of warnings; the code is almost warning free
808f73c55d85e57b7b85e2112a4ecee17aa90684 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/jason-ziolo/ClueGame_New
304aa3af41fe273a537f87e307a108be472f3a44 REFACTOR: calcAdjacencies readability
bcd9e5e6808d60bc800aafbb62492cf4bb497f52 REFACTOR - Changed the way loadMiscConfigFiles was called. Before, it was called outside of board.initialize(), so I moved it into initialize (since it is being initialized) and removed all the miscellaneous calls
8b211bbd293893e04e6c35ebde63c45c07628de7 REFACTOR -  commented the makeAccusation function and refactored some of the code into a function to make in more readable.
e60a4fc97b26422a9c0cbd5c85ae20f04fcccc85 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/jason-ziolo/ClueGame_New
e44b906801f4a7336843748955c40434b85b9605 miscellaneous reformatting

8305e1739673c6c19938e5c764cb1cf13387e36b REFACTOR - changed the handleSuggestion function dramtically. It now calls the Player function disproveSuggestion (didn't previously) and made the handleSuggestion function create very few intermidiate variables.
15b268748f3338665e0b3139955cf8485d165504 REFACTOR: More definition of magic constants in BoardCell, more tinkering w/ colors

8ac94f30a08c9cf823655bdcbc6e09e62ae0e0ac REFACTOR - Moved the seenCards array into board, rather than having a specific instance of the same array for every Player. Also changed some makeAccusation functionality. If something is wrong with seenCards, go to the commit before this one, it will probably fix the problem
c4b2c6f10a36af443394b86909dc90ca93e5a8ab merge conflicts fixed
